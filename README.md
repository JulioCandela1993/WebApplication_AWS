# Experimentation  

## Task 4.1: Download the repository for the Web App
 
The resources and changes for the web server can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/JulioCandela1993/eb-django-express-signup.git 

## Task 4.2: Create an IAM Policy and Role 

The IAM Policy (gsg-signup-policy) and Role (gsg-signup-role) were succesfully created 

## Task 4.3: Create a DynamoDB Table 

The gsg-signup-table was successfully created in Ireland region.

## Task 4.4: Test the web app locally

Before the execution, we had to modify the file environment.bat (Windows) since we got some problems in the set of variables (without quotes) and be sure that the aws configuration was set to the region specified (eu-west-1, you can use the command "aws configure"):

##### @ECHO OFF 
##### SET DEBUG="True" 
##### SET STARTUP_SIGNUP_TABLE=gsg-signup-table 
##### SET AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
##### ECHO %DEBUG%, %STARTUP_SIGNUP_TABLE%, %AWS_REGION%

The server is succesfully running after executing the python scripts:

In order to validate the result of the insertion, we opened the DynamoDB console in AWS and get the elements stored in the table (our email accounts, names and decisions of preview)

## Task 4.5: Create the AWS Beanstalk environment and deploy the sample web app

During these steps, we faced some problems: 
- First of all, the account must be validated in the region "Ireland". We sent an email to Amazon to allow this region for our account in EC2.
- Then, the load balancer requires at least two sub regions, so in the configuration we changed it to sub region a and b.

At the end, we could initiallize the web application:

## Task 4.6: Configure Elastic Beanstalk CLI and deploy the target web app

After facing some problems at the beginning, we executed the new code provided by the course and the app was working without inconvenients:
